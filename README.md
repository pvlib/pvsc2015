# pvlib-pvsc2015
This repository contains files relevant to the PVLIB-Python PVSC 2015 poster coauthored by Will Holmgren, Rob Andrews, Tony Lorenzo, and Josh Stein. 

Files:
* ``paper.ipynb`` is an IPython notebook with the code used to generate figures for the paper and the poster. It also has directions for how to install the packages needed to run the analysis. You can view it in GitHub or at this [nbviewer link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pvlib/pvsc2015/blob/master/paper.ipynb) (with nicer formatting).
* ``pvlib_pvsc_42.tex`` and ``pvlib_pvsc_42.bib`` are the tex files for the paper.
* ``pvlib_pvsc_42.pdf`` is the compiled paper pdf.
* ``poster.pptx`` is the MS PowerPoint poster (gross, I know).
* ``poster.pdf`` is a pdf version of the poster.

See the Releases tab for the version submitted to PVSC.
